when reading a file over the network, there is a constant stream of data
each byte / packet will be transformed using RLNC and transmitted using UDP
the requestee will continue to consume packets until the requested data can be fully decoded
	dropped packets do not add delay / hitch to the file data stream as further RLNC packets will fill in the gaps
